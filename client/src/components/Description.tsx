        Hallo, Servus, and welcome to this page! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Felicia (Feli)
        and I'm a girl from Germany living in the US - in Cincinnati, Ohio to be
        precise. I've decided to create this page for people who would like to
        support my channel but are hesitant about becoming a patron on Patreon.
        So if you want, you can buy me a "coffee" on here - which in my case
        really means beer or Chai Latte haha because I don't actually drink
        coffee. :) Thank you so much! I appreciate each and every one who
        supports me and my channel.
      </p>
    </div>
